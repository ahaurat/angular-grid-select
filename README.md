Linked set of dropdown menus created with AngularJS

The concept is a collection of dropdown menus for different charitable causes that display organizations related to each cause. Each cause displays a count of how many organizations have been selected within that cause. The tricky part is that some organizations are listed under multiple causes and so keeping all the counts correct required a bit of work.
