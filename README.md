A linked set of dropdown menus created with AngularJS

Concept: Users can see various charitable causes and select organizations they want to support/follow that work for those causes.

Implementation: A collection of linked dropdown menus. Each cause displays a count of how many organizations have been selected within that cause. The tricky part is that some organizations are listed under multiple causes and so keeping all the counts correct required a bit of work. You can see a live version here:
